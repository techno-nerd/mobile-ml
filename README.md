# Running ML Models on Mobile

This project consists of a front-end mobile app (`MobileML`) and a Flask backend server (`backend`). The camera input from the phone is sent to the backend for prediction when the screen is clicked.

Unfortunately, the model accuracy is not very good, as you can see with this [video](). However, this is more of a template for loading more advanced models in the future.

To test it out, first complete the set-up instructions detailed by the `README.md` in `backend` and `MobileML`.

Then:
1. Start the Flask server.
2. Start expo and open it on Expo Go
3. Click the screen to get prediction
